## Introduction

In today's world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the demand for efficient GPU usage is at an all-time high. Tensor Fusion addresses this need by providing a powerful framework for GPU virtualization. By pooling GPU resources, Tensor Fusion allows for better scheduling and utilization, ensuring that every computation task runs smoothly.

## Features

- **GPU Virtualization**: Create virtual GPUs (vGPUs) to share physical GPU resources among multiple applications.
- **Dynamic Pooling**: Automatically allocate GPU resources based on demand.
- **Efficient Scheduling**: Optimize GPU usage with intelligent scheduling algorithms.
- **Support for Major Frameworks**: Works seamlessly with popular AI frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- **Autoscaling**: Automatically adjust GPU resources to match workload requirements.
- **Inference Optimization**: Improve the performance of inference tasks for large language models (LLMs).

## Installation

To install Tensor Fusion, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naito-ez/tensor-fusion.git
   cd tensor-fusion
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   Build the project using the provided scripts:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

4. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Naito-ez/tensor-fusion/releases) section to download the latest version. Follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the necessary files.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using Tensor Fusion. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

1. **Start the Service**:
   ```bash
   ./start_service.sh
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual GPU**:
   Use the following command to create a virtual GPU:
   ```bash
   ./create_vgpu.sh --name my_vgpu --memory 4GB
   ```

3. **Run Your AI Model**:
   Point your AI model to the created virtual GPU:
   ```python
   import torch

   device = torch.device("cuda:my_vgpu")
   model = MyModel().to(device)
   ```

## Configuration

Tensor Fusion allows for extensive configuration to suit your needs. You can modify the configuration file located at `config/config.yaml`. Here are some key parameters you can adjust:

- **max_memory**: Set the maximum memory available for each virtual GPU.
- **autoscale**: Enable or disable autoscaling based on workload.
- **scheduling_algorithm**: Choose between different scheduling algorithms (e.g., FIFO, Round Robin).
